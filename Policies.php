                  Rent2Ryde Inc. (“Rent2Ryde”, “we”, or “us”), provides an online car sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with travelers and locals seeking to book those vehicles. Rent2Ryde is accessible online including at Rent2Ryde.com and as an application for mobile devices. The Rent2Ryde websites, blog, mobile applications, and associated services are collectively referred to as “the Services”. By accessing or using the Services, including by communicating with us or other Rent2Ryde users, you agree to comply with, and be legally bound by, the provisions of these Terms of Service (these “Terms”), whether or not you become a registered user of the Services. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Rent2Ryde.

                  These Terms, together with the cancellation policy, nondiscrimination policy, applicable insurance terms and certificates, roadside assistance terms, and the additional policies (together, the “Policies”) constitute the “Agreement” between you and Rent2Ryde (each a “Party” and together, “the Parties”). In addition, Rent2Ryde provides a Car Sharing Agreement that summarizes the terms of each reservation, accessible in the Services for any booked or previous trips and you may use it as proof of a reservation.

                  <br><b>Modification</b>. Rent2Ryde reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify the Services or to modify the Agreement, including these Terms, at any time. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Services. We will also update the “Last Revised” date at the top of these Terms. If you continue to access or use the Services after we have posted a modification or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified terms. If the modified terms are not acceptable to you, your sole recourse is to stop using and accessing the Services and close your Rent2Ryde Account within 30 days. If you choose to close your Rent2Ryde Account, the previous effective version of these Terms will apply to you, unless you use the Services during the intervening 30 day period, in which case the new version of these Terms will apply to you.</p>

                  To access certain features of the Services, you must sign up for an account with us (a “Turo Account”). You can create a Turo Account by providing us your first and last name, email address, mobile phone number, and creating a password or connecting through an account with a third-party site or service (including Apple, Facebook, and Google). When you book a vehicle as a traveler or guest (“guest”), you provide us with certain additional information about yourself. Similarly, when you list a vehicle as a vehicle owner or host (“host”), you provide us with certain additional information about yourself and your vehicle(s) (if applicable). You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration, booking, and/or listing process. You must keep your Turo Account up to date at all times. Based on information you provide, Turo may impose additional requirements for you to book a trip (e.g., providing a deposit, adding a second form of payment, buying a certain level of protection plan, or other requirements).</p>
